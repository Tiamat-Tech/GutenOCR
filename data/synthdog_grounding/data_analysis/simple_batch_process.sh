# Simple SynthDoG Statistics Processor
#
# A lightweight version of the batch statistics processor that focuses on
# processing only the remaining tar files that don't have statistics yet.
# This script is useful for resuming interrupted batch processing operations.
#
# Features:
# - Quick check for existing stats files
# - Processes only missing statistics
# - Minimal logging for faster execution
# - Progress reporting every 20 files
#
# Usage:
#   ./simple_batch_process.sh
#
# Output:
#   Creates .stats.csv files for tar files that don't have them yet
#
# Requirements:
#   - generate_stats.py in the same directory
#   - uv package manager
#
# Environment Variables:
#   SYNTHDOG_DATA_DIR - Override the default dataset directory
#

# Configuration - use arg, then env var, then default
